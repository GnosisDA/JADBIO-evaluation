PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Impact Of High Sugar Diet On L-Arginine Metabolism In The Lung
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Asthma is a progressive inflammatory airways disease that leads to structural
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	airway changes and debilitating symptoms in many severely affected adults. We
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	need novel therapeutic agents that are affordable, can decrease the reliance on
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	steroids, and can improve quality of life. This clinical and mechanistic study
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	has the potential to impact treatment of a subset of adult severe asthmatics and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	to further our understanding of the mechanisms of L-arginine metabolism and NO
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	biology in the airways of asthmatics. We will pursue a clinical trial in
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	subjects not well controlled on standard drug therapy; this strategy will
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	address whether L-arginine is efficacious in patients receiving standard of care
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	medications. In studies using animal models, we and others have shown that
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	interventions that augment NO levels, through either supplementation of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	L-arginine or inhibition of arginase, decrease allergic airway inflammation and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	hyperresponsiveness-the two hallmarks of asthma. Overall, we hypothesize that a
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	responder subset of adult severe asthma patients will derive clinical benefit
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	from supplemental L-arginine therapy and that these patients will have a lower
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	exhaled NO concentrations (<20 ppb) and a higher NOS2/Arg1 mRNA and protein
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	ratio in their airway epithelial cells than non-responders. We aim to: 1) test
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	the hypothesis that uncontrolled, adult severe asthma patients with exhaled
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	breath NO concentrations <20 ppb will have fewer asthma exacerbations over 3
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	months when treated with L-arginine compared to patients with FeNO > 25, 2)
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	determine the mechanisms by which L-arginine affects the regulation of NOS and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	arginase enzymes in primary airway epithelial cell cultures from severe
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	asthmatic subjects, and 3) test the hypothesis that inhaled nanoparticle carrier
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	formulations of L-arginine will decrease airway inflammation, airway
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	hyperresponsiveness, and airway fibrosis at lower doses than systemically
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	administered L-arginine. The major impact of our study will be to identify the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	adult severe asthma cohort that will benefit from supplemental L-arginine
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	therapy. Our ultimate goal is to develop novel therapeutic agents to treat adult
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	severe asthma patients better. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is a progressive
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	inflammatory airways disease that leads to structural airway changes and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	debilitating symptoms in many severely affected adults. This clinical study has
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	the potential to improve the care of adult severe asthmatics and to further our
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	understanding of the mechanisms of L-arginine metabolism and nitric oxide
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	biology in the lung. If we demonstrate that L-arginine supplementation can
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	decrease asthma attacks in a subset of severe asthmatics, it will have great
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	implications for future research as well as for the daily lives of patients with
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	asthma.

#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	C57BL/6 mice, 6-7 weeks of age upon diet assignment were fed for 150 days and
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	weighed daily. Mice were euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbital IP and
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	lungs were flash frozen. 6 mg of lung tissue was extracted for GC-TOFMS and
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	HILIC-QTOFMS analysis.
CO:SAMPLE_TYPE                   	Tissue
#TREATMENT
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Male C57BL/6N mice (6-7 weeks of age) were provided ad libitum access to one of
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	three diets for 150 days: low fat (10% kcals) control (CTRL) chow, high fat (45%
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	kcals) with sugar (HFS) chow or very high (60% kcals) fat (VHF) chow. Body
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	weight and food intake were measured daily.
TR:TREATMENT_DOSEDURATION        	150 Days
#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	1. Weigh 50 mg tissue sample in to a 25 ml conical polypropylene centrifuge
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	tube. 2. Add 2.5mL extraction solvent to the tissue sample and homogenize for 45
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	seconds ensuring that sample resembles a powder. In between samples, clean the
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	homogenizer in solutions of methanol, acetone, water, and the extraction
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	solvent. 3. Centrifuge the samples at 2500 rpm. for 5 minutes. Aliquot 2 X
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	500?l supernatant, one for analysis and one for a backup sample. Store backup
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	aliquot in the -20°C freezer. 4. Evaporate one 500?l aliquot of the sample in
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	the Labconco Centrivap cold trap concentrator to complete dryness 5. The dried
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	aliquot is then re-suspended with 500l 50% acetonitrile (degassed as given) 6.
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Centrifuge for 2 min at 14000 rcf using the centrifuge Eppendorf 5415. 7. Remove
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	supernatant to a new Eppendorff tube. 8. Evaporate the supernatant to dryness in
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	the the Labconco Centrivap cold trap concentrator. 9. Submit to derivatization.
SP:SAMPLEPREP_PROTOCOL_FILENAME  	SOP_Extraction_of_Mammalian_Tissue_Samples.pdf
SP:SAMPLEPREP_PROTOCOL_COMMENTS  	This study combined 2 different injection volumes for certain samples when
SP:SAMPLEPREP_PROTOCOL_COMMENTS  	processing positive mode data. The reason for this was because in certain
SP:SAMPLEPREP_PROTOCOL_COMMENTS  	samples the TG's were overloaded with the 1uL injections, but everything else
SP:SAMPLEPREP_PROTOCOL_COMMENTS  	was at a normal peak height. Therefore samples were run at a 0.1uL injection
SP:SAMPLEPREP_PROTOCOL_COMMENTS  	volume and took the data from 9-12.5 minutes because that's when TG's elute. The
SP:SAMPLEPREP_PROTOCOL_COMMENTS  	samples that were injected at 0.1uL were used for times 9 min-12.5 min and the
SP:SAMPLEPREP_PROTOCOL_COMMENTS  	1uL samples were used for times 0-8.99min.
