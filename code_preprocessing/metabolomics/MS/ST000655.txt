PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins are implicated in soybean oil-induced obesity in
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	mice
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	In this study we have compared the metabolic effects of conventional soybean oil
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	to those of genetically modified Plenish soybean oil, that is low in linoleic
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	acid and high in oleic acid. This work builds on our previous study showing that
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	soybean oil, rich in polyunsaturated fats, is more obesogenic and diabetogenic
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	than coconut oil, rich in saturated fats (PMID: 26200659). Here, in order to
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	elucidate the mechanisms responsible for soybean oil induced obesity, we have
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	performed the first ever metabolomics (in plasma and liver) and proteomics on
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	the livers of mice fed the two soybean oil diets (plus those fed a high coconut
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	oil and Viv chow diet). Our results show that the new high oleic soybean oil
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	induces less obesity and adiposity than conventional soybean oil, but can cause
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction. Metabolomic analysis reveals that the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	hepatic and plasma metabolic profiles differ considerably between the two
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	soybean oils. Hepatic C18 oxylipin metabolites of omega-6 (ω6) and omega-3
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	(ω3) fatty acids (linoleic and α-linolenic acid, respectively) in the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	cytochrome P450/soluble epoxide hydrolase pathway were found to correlate
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	positively with obesity.
