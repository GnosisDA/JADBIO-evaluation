PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Reproducibility study: The common feature of leukemia-associated IDH1 and IDH2
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	mutations is a neomorphic enzyme activity converting alpha-ketoglutarate to
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	2-hydroxyglutarate
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology seeks to address growing concerns
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	about reproducibility in scientific research by conducting replications of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	selected experiments from a number of high-profile papers in the field of cancer
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	biology. The papers, which were published between 2010 and 2012, were selected
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	on the basis of citations and Altmetric scores (Errington et al., 2014). This
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Registered Report describes the proposed replication plan of key experiments
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	from “The common feature of leukemia-associated IDH1 and IDH2 mutations is a

PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	(Ward et al., 2010). The experiments that will be replicated are those reported
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	in Figures 2, 3 and 5. Ward and colleagues demonstrate the mutations in
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), commonly found in acute myeloid leukemia
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	(AML), abrogate the enzyme’s wild-type activity and confer to the mutant
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	neomorphic activity that produces the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG)
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	(Figures 2 and 3). They then show that elevated levels of 2-HG are correlated
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	with mutations in IDH1 and IDH2in AML patient samples (Figure 5). The
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is a collaboration between the Center
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	for Open Science and Science Exchange and the results of the replications
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	will be published by eLife.

#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	293T Cells were harvested 24 and 48 hours after transfection by removal of media
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	and rapid quenching with 1.5 mL per 10 cm plate of -80°C methanol. Cells were
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	incubated at -80°C for 15 minutesmin, then scraped off the dish and centrifuged
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	for 5 min at 2,000 x g at 4°C to pellet cellular debris. Pellet was
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	re-extracted by addition of 500 µL of -80°C 80% methanol in water, vortexed,
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	then incubated at 4°C for 15 minutes and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 2,000 x g
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	at 4°C. Peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells were centrifuged at 2,000 x g,
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	freeze media removed and extracted using same procedure as 293T cells.

SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	10 mL 3 N HCl. Samples were evaporated to dryness and re-suspended in 100 µL
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	MTBSTFA/ACN (1:1, v/v) and shaken at 60°C for 1 hour. Derivatized extracts were
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	further diluted (1:4) with a MTBSTFA/ACN (1:1, v/v) mixture and transferred to
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	glass vials with micro-inserts and capped immediately.
