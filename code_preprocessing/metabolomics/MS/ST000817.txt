#PROJECT
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Toxoplasma metabolomics
PR:PROJECT_TYPE                  	Metabolic alterations in wild type vs glycolytic and gluconeogenesis mutants
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	The focus of this study was to profile the metabolic fates of glucose and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	glutamine in wild type, glycolytic mutant (hexokinase KO) and gluconeogenesis
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	mutant (PEPCK1 KO) tachyzoite stage T. gondii parasites. 13C6-glucose and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	13C5-15N1-glutamine were used as metabolic tracers. Metabolites from glycolysis,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	pentosephosphate pathway and Kerbs cycle were identified and their isotopomer
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	abundance was quantified in order to visualize metabolic flux across the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	indicated pathways. A time course (from 0 minutes to 120 minutes) analysis was
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	carried out in the labeling experiments. Here, host cell free extracellular
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	tachyzoite stage T. gondii parasites were used.
