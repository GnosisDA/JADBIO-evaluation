PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Liver fibrosis is the result of chronic liver damage from various etiologies
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	toxins, alcohol abuse, obesity, or viral hepatitis. Chronic liver disease may
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	to cirrhosis, an end stage organ disease, and liver cancer. Patients with
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	liver disease show intestinal bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis. They also
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	increased intestinal permeability, and disease severity correlates with
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	levels of bacterial products. Although experimental liver fibrosis is dependent
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	gut derived bacterial products, the exact contribution of the commensal
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	to chronic liver disease in unknown. Since the interaction of bacterial
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	with the innate immune system can also confer protection to the host, we
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	germfree mice to experimental models of liver fibrosis. Results from our
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	demonstrate that germfree mice show exacerbated liver fibrosis as compared to
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	mice. Our previous studies also have indicated that a bacterial metabolite of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Indole-3-propionic Acid (IPA), is absent in germ free mice. In this study we

SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	in methanol] was added to each tube and were vortexed for 2 min at 5000 rpm.
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	samples were centrifuged at 16,000 rcf for 4 min. A 90 µL of the supernatant

SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Formic Acid. Samples were then mixed on a multiple tube vortexer for 5 min at
