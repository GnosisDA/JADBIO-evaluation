PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins are implicated in soybean oil-induced obesity in
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	mice
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	In this study we have compared the metabolic effects of conventional soybean oil
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	to those of genetically modified Plenish soybean oil, that is low in linoleic
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	acid and high in oleic acid. This work builds on our previous study showing that
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	soybean oil, rich in polyunsaturated fats, is more obesogenic and diabetogenic
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	than coconut oil, rich in saturated fats (PMID: 26200659). Here, in order to
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	elucidate the mechanisms responsible for soybean oil induced obesity, we have
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	performed the first ever metabolomics (in plasma and liver) and proteomics on
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	the livers of mice fed the two soybean oil diets (plus those fed a high coconut
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	oil and Viv chow diet). Our results show that the new high oleic soybean oil
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	induces less obesity and adiposity than conventional soybean oil, but can cause
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction. Metabolomic analysis reveals that the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	hepatic and plasma metabolic profiles differ considerably between the two
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	soybean oils. Hepatic C18 oxylipin metabolites of omega-6 (ω6) and omega-3
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	(ω3) fatty acids (linoleic and α-linolenic acid, respectively) in the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	cytochrome P450/soluble epoxide hydrolase pathway were found to correlate
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	positively with obesity.

#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Liver tissue from mice on the diets for 24 weeks for metabolomic analysis was
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	collected, rinsed in cold PBS, excess fluid was blotted with a kim-wipe and
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	tissue was immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at -80°C.
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and centrifuged at 9 rcf for 5 min at
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	4°C. Plasma was stored immediately at -20°C.
#TREATMENT
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Male C57/BL6N mice weaned at 3weeks of age were randomly assigned to one of the
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	four diets: 1) VIV chow: normal rodent chow, low in fat and high in fiber 2)
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	HFD: 40 kcal% coconut oil 3) LA-HFD: 40 kcal% total fat soybean oil diet (21
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	kcal% from coconut oil and 19 kcal% from soybean oil) 4) PL-HFD: 40 kcal% total
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	fat Plenish oil diet (21 kcal% from coconut oil and 19 kcal% from Plenish oil)
#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	1. Switch on bath to pre-cool at –20°C (±2°C validity temperature range) 2.
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Gently rotate or aspirate the blood samples for about 10s to obtain a
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	homogenised sample. 3. Aliquot 30μl of plasma sample to a 1.0 mL extraction
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	solution. The extraction solution has to be prechilled using the ThermoElectron
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Neslab RTE 740 cooling bath set to -20°C. 4. Vortex the sample for about 10s
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	and shake for 5 min at 4°C using the Orbital Mixing Chilling/Heating Plate. If
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	you are using more than one sample, keep the rest of the sample on ice (chilled
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	at <0°C with sodium chloride). 5. Centrifuge samples for 2min at 14000 rcf
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	using the centrifuge Eppendorf 5415 D. 6. Aliquot two 450μL portions of the
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	supernatant. One for analysis and one for a backup sample. Store the backup
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	aliquot in -20°C freezer. 7. Evaporate one 450μL aliquots of the sample in the
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Labconco Centrivap cold trap concentrator to complete dryness. 8. The dried
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	aliquot is then re-suspended with 450 μL 50% acetonitrile (degassed as given
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	above). 9. Centrifuged for 2 min at 14000 rcf using the centrifuge Eppendorf
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	5415. 10. Remove supernatant to a new Eppendorf tube. 11. Evaporate the
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	supernatant to dryness in the Labconco Centrivap cold trap concentrator. 12.
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Submit to derivatization.
