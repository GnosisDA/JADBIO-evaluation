PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Comparison of Metabolites Variation and Antiobesity Effects of a Mixture of
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Cudrania tricuspidata, Lonicera caerulea, and the Soybean According to
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Fermentation in vitro and in vivo
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	We used ultra-performance-liquid-chromatography with quadrupole-time-of-flight
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	mass spectrometry to study the changes in metabolites in the mixture of Cudrania
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	tricuspidata, Lonicera caerulea, and soybean (CLM) during fermentation.
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Additionally, the antiobesity effects of CLM and fermented-CLM (FCLM) were
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	studied based on the analysis of plasma from high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. The
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	levels of cyanidin and the glycosides of luteolin, quercetin, and cyanidin
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	derived from L. caerulea were decreased, whereas the levels of luteolin and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	quercetin were increased during fermentation. Isoflavone glycosides and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	soyasaponins originating from the soybean were decreased, whereas their
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	aglycones such as daidzein, glycitein, and genistein were increased. As for
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	prenylated flavonoids from C. tricuspidata, these metabolites were decreased at
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	the early stage of fermentation, and were increased at end of the fermentation.
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	In terms of the functional food product, various metabolites derived from
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	diverse natural products in CLM had complementary effects and demonstrated
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	higher antioxidant and pancreatic lipase inhibition activities by fermentation;
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	these activities were closely related to flavonoid aglycones including
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	genistein, daidzein, glycitein, luteolin, and quercetin. In vivo experiment,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	several clinical parameters affected by HFD were remarkably improved by the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	administration of either CLM or FCLM, but there was a difference in the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	antiobesity effects. The levels of lysoPCs with C20:4, C16:0, and C22:6 were
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	significantly attenuated by CLM administration, while the attenuated levels of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	lysoPCs with C20:4 and C18:2 were significantly restored by FCLM administration.
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	These metabolites may explain the above-mentioned differences in antiobesity
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	effects. Although only the changes in plasma lysophospholipids could not fully
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	explain antiobesity effects between non-fermented and fermented plant mixtures
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	from our results, we suggest that metabolomics approach could provide a way to
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	reveal the metabolite alterations in the complex fermentation process and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	understand the differences or changes in bioactivity according to fermentation.

#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Plasma 200uL were extracted with 1mL of 80% MeOH
#TREATMENT
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Seven-week-old C57BL6J male mice were purchased from Daehan bio-link (Chungbuk,
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Republic of Korea). All mice were acclimated for 1 week under controlled
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	conditions (temperature: 25 ± 2°C, relative humidity: 50 ± 5%, and 12 h
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	light/dark cycle). The animals had free access to a normal diet (AIN-76A,
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Research Diets, Inc., NJ, USA) and water. After 1 week, the mice were randomly
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	distributed into 5 groups: (1) group normal-diet (ND) (n = 11) was fed a normal
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	diet for 6 weeks, (2) group HFD (named HD; n = 10) was fed 60 kcal% fat (D1242,
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Research Diets, Inc., NJ, USA) for 6 weeks, (3) group HFD with xenical
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	administration (HX, 50 mg?kg?1?day?1) n = 10, 6 weeks, (4) group HFD
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	with CLM administration (HCLM, 2 g?kg?1?day?1) n = 10, 6 weeks; and (5)
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	group HFD with FCLM (CLM fermented for 60 h) administration (HFCLM, 2
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	g?kg?1?day?1) n = 8, 6 weeks. In this study, we used xenical as a
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	positive control for antiobesity effects. Xenical, CLM, and FCLM dissolved with
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	saline were orally administered everyday into the stomach with an oral zonde
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	needle. And, the equal volume of saline were applied for ND and HD groups.
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	During the experimental periods, the feed intake and the body weight of the mice
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	were measured daily.

#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	For blood collection, the mice were sacrificed by cardiac puncture. Plasma (100
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	µL) was subjected to extraction with cold methanol (500 µL) on a MM400 mixer
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	mill (Retsch®, Haan, Germany) with the frequency 30 s?1 for 5 min. The
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	suspension was centrifuged at 12,578 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	filtered through a 0.2-µm PTEE filter and evaporated in a speed vacuum
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	concentrator. The final concentration of the plasma was 5 mg/mL in methanol for
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	the UPLC-Q-TOF-MS analysis.
