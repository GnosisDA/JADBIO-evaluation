#STUDY
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	Amino Acid Quantifcation of obese patients on a 16 week caloric restriction from
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	muscle biopsy (part II)
ST:STUDY_TYPE                    	timecourse, quantitative measurements of amino acid
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	Caloric restriction (CR) improves insulin sensitivity and reduces the incidence
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	of diabetes in obese individuals. The underlying mechanisms whereby CR improves
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	insulin sensitivity are not clear. We evaluated the effect of 16 weeks of CR on
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	whole-body insulin sensitivity by pancreatic clamp before and after CR in 11
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	obese participants (BMI = 35 kg/m2) compared with 9 matched control subjects
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	(BMI = 34 kg/m2). Compared with the control subjects, CR increased the glucose
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	infusion rate needed to maintain euglycemia during hyperinsulinemia, indicating
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	enhancement of peripheral insulin sensitivity. This improvement in insulin
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	sensitivity was not accompanied by changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	oxidative capacity or oxidant emissions, nor were there changes in skeletal
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	muscle ceramide, diacylglycerol, or amino acid metabolite levels. However, CR
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	lowered insulin-stimulated thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) levels and
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	enhanced nonoxidative glucose disposal. These results support a role for TXNIP
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	in mediating the improvement in peripheral insulin sensitivity after CR.

#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Blood samples were collected in a heated hotbox (131°F) through a retrograde
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	intravenous catheter at baseline for glucose and hormone levels, and every 10
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	min during the clamp to maintain euglycemia. In addition, blood samples were
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	collected every 20 min from 0600 to 0700, 0900 to 1000, and 1200 to 1300 to
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	measure plasma [6,62H2]glucose. At 1330 h, a percutaneous needle muscle biopsy
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	specimen (350–400 mg) was obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle under
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	local anesthesia, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°F
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	for future analysis (27). This biopsy sample was used for analysis of TXNIP mRNA
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	and protein content. The participant remained in the CRU through the remainder
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	of the day and was given a weight-maintenance diet until 2200 h. At 0700 h the
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	following morning, a second muscle biopsy specimen was obtained under local
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	anesthesia, and ∼100 mg was used immediately for mitochondrial function
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	measurements of isolated mitochondria and mtH2O2 emissions (28). The remainder
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°F for future
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	analysis, including DAG, ceramide, and amino acid measurements (Fig. 1).

#TREATMENT
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Before and after 16 weeks of CR or CON, two outpatient visits and one inpatient
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	visit were scheduled. Before the outpatient visits, participants were instructed
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	to fast overnight from 10:00 p.m. the evening before and to avoid strenuous
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	exercise for 24 h preceding the visits. One outpatient visit consisted of an MRI
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	to measure subcutaneous and visceral fat distribution and magnetic resonance
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	spectroscopy to measure skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (25). The second
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	outpatient visit was for measurements of resting energy expenditure (REE) for
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	the calculation of a weight-maintenance diet (Parvo Medics TrueOne 2400 Canopy
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	system), DEXA scan (Lunar DPX-L; Lunar Radiation, Madison, WI), and VO2peak test
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	on a bicycle ergometer (Fig. 1). Participants were admitted to the Clinical
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Research Unit (CRU) on the evening of the fifth day of the weight-maintaining
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	diet provided by the CRU metabolic kitchen (Supplementary Fig. 1). The
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	weight-maintenance meals (diet composition: 20% protein, 30% fat, 50%
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	carbohydrate) were monitored daily to ensure that the correct calorie level was
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	achieved. Upon admission to the CRU, no calories were consumed after 2100 h to
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	achieve a 10-h fast before the two-stage insulin euglycemic pancreatic clamp the
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	following morning, as previously published (26), with modifications as follows:
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	the following morning at 0400 h, a primed [6,62H2]glucose bolus (6 mg ⋅ kg
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	fat-free mass[FFM]−1) was administered, followed by a 9-h continuous infusion
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	of [6,62H2]glucose (started at 4 mg ⋅ kgFFM−1 ⋅ h−1 then titrated
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	downward over the infusion time period to match anticipated changes in
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	endogenous glucose production [EGP]). At 0600 h, gas exchange was measured by
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	indirect calorimetry for 30 min for REE determination. Then at 0700 h, glucagon
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	(0.001 μg ⋅ kgFFM−1 ⋅ min−1), somatostatin (0.093 μg ⋅ kgFFM−1 ⋅
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	min−1), and growth hormone (0.0047 μg ⋅ kgFFM−1 ⋅ min−1) were infused
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	for 6 h. Insulin was infused from 0700 to 1000 h at 0.62 mU ⋅ kgFFM−1 ⋅
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	min−1 and then from 1000 to 1300 h at 2.3 mU ⋅ kgFFM−1 ⋅ min−1. A 40%
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	dextrose with 2% enrichment of [6,62H2]glucose was infused as needed to maintain
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	blood glucose above 4.7 mmol/L from 0700 to 1000 h and then between 4.7 and 5.3
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	mmol/L from 1000 to 1300 h.
#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	All measurements were made on the second biopsy sample taken after an overnight
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	fast. Concentrations of amino acids and metabolites were determined using
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	MassTrak Amino Acid Solution (Waters) modified for mass spectrometry as
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	previously described (32). Muscle samples were spiked with internal standards
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	for amino acids and metabolites, deproteinated using cold methanol, and
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	centrifuged.
#CHROMATOGRAPHY
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	High resolution separation was done using an Acquity UPLC system, injecting 1
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	µl of derviatized solution, with a UPLC BEH C18 1.7 micron 2.1×150 mm column
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	from Waters. Column flow was set to 400 µl/min with a gradient from 99.9%A to
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	98%B where buffer A is 1% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid and buffer B is 100%
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	acetonitrile. A column temp of 43 degrees Celsius and a sample tray temp of 6%
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	Celsius. Mass detection was completed on a TSQ Ultra Quantum from Thermo
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	Finnigan running in ESI positive mode. A scan width of 0.002, scan time of 0.04
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	seconds per transition mass, collision energy of 25, collision gas pressure of
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	1.5 mTorr, tube lens value set to 90, monitoring a signature ion of the
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	derivitized amines at m/z 171.04 by selected reaction monitoring.
