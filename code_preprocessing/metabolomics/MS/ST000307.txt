TR:ANIMAL_ACCLIMATION_DURATION   	Mice from Jackson are subjected to a week-long acclimation period in our
TR:ANIMAL_ACCLIMATION_DURATION   	facility prior to experimental use.
TR:ANIMAL_ENDP_TISSUE_COLL_LIST  	Spleen into cell culture media
TR:ANIMAL_ENDP_TISSUE_PROC_METHOD	Spleens were ground through a 100µm cell filter to create a single cell
TR:ANIMAL_ENDP_TISSUE_PROC_METHOD	suspension and rinsed in culture media (see below). Splenocytes were subjected
TR:ANIMAL_ENDP_TISSUE_PROC_METHOD	to RBC Lysis (Qiagen) and CD8+ T cells were isolated by negative immunomagnetic
TR:ANIMAL_ENDP_TISSUE_PROC_METHOD	selection in a special medium (PBS+ FBS + 2mM EDTA). Briefly, splenocytes were
TR:ANIMAL_ENDP_TISSUE_PROC_METHOD	labeled with biotinylated antibodies to cell surface markers not found on CD8+ T
TR:ANIMAL_ENDP_TISSUE_PROC_METHOD	cells, and secondary antibodies to biotin containing magnetic beads were added
TR:ANIMAL_ENDP_TISSUE_PROC_METHOD	to this single cell suspension (Kit from Miltenyi Biotech). Cells were passed
TR:ANIMAL_ENDP_TISSUE_PROC_METHOD	through a magnetic column following this labeling. CD8+ T cells were
TR:ANIMAL_ENDP_TISSUE_PROC_METHOD	re-suspended in culture media.
TR:CELL_GROWTH_CONTAINER         	96-well round-bottom plate that was coated with anti-CD3 antibody
TR:CELL_GROWTH_RATE              	Murine T cells generally divide after 48-72 hours of stimulation.
