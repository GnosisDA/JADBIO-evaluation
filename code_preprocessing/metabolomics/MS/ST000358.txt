#PROJECT
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Metabolic Profiling of Anxiety Prone HSV-Latently Infected Obese Mice
PR:PROJECT_TYPE                  	Broad Spectrum LCMS
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	The biological factors that lead children from low socioeconomic backgrounds to
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	be at greater risk for the development of anxiety and learning problems are not
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	well understood. While it is clear that there are genetic components to the risk
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	of developing mental health disorders, a role for environmental factors in
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	inducing these problems has been suggested. Many of these factors that affect
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	the brain likely involve exposures that occur early in life. Two such factors
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	are the higher rates of herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 seropositivity and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	prevalence of obesity among these children. HSV-1 infection has been associated
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	with impaired cognition during childhood and mental health problems in
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	adulthood. Additionally, obese adults are shown to have higher HSV-1 titers.
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Similarly, other studies have correlated a diet high in saturated fat and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	obesity with increased risk of mood disorders and anxiety. A mouse model of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	obese HSV-1 latent infection was developed. Broad spectrum metabolomics analysis
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	was performed to better understand the metabolomic profile of hippocampus and to
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	compare this metabolomics profile with that of the hypothalamus, microglia, and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Brain tissue samples for metabolomics
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	experiments were generated in the following manner: 3-week old mice were placed
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	on a 10% low fat (LF) diet and acclimated for one week prior to intranasal HSV-1
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	infection or mock infection with PBS. Fourteen days post-infection mice were
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	randomized to either a 45% high fat diet (HF) or remained on the LF diet. Eight
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	weeks post-diet transition, mice were euthanized and brain tissue samples were
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	collected and processed for metabolomics.

#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Brain tissue samples were homogenized in 50:50 Acetonitrile:Water (10 µL to
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	every 1 mg of tissue) with washed ceramic beads on a MagNA Lyser, using two 30
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	sec pulses at 2,000 rpm with a 1 min chilling step in between pulses. Samples
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	were vortexed on a multi-tube vortexer for 2 min at 5,000 rpm and centrifuged at
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	room temperature for 4 min at 16,000 rcf. A 50 µL aliquot of each experimental
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	brain tissue homogenized supernatant was transferred to a labeled 2.0 mL Lo-Bind
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	eppendorf tube. Analytical pooled samples were created by combining 15 µL
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	aliquot from each experimental sample in a 2.0 mL Lo-Bind eppendorf tube. The QC
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	pooled sample was vortexed for 30 sec and 50 µL aliquots were transferred to 5
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	labeled 2.0 mL Lo-Bind eppendorf tubes. Next, 350 µL of acetonitrile was added
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	to study sample and QC pooled sample tubes. The samples were vortexed on a
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	multi-tube vortexer for 2 min at 5,000 rpm, and centrifuged at room temperature
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	for 4 min at 16,000 rcf. The supernatants were transferred to new labeled tubes
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	and dried on a lyophilizer overnight. Dried samples were reconstituted in 50 µL
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	of 95:5 Water:Methanol, mixed on an analog vortex mixer for 1 min with speed set
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	at 10. Then, the samples were centrifuged at room temperature for 4 min at
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	16,000 rcf, and the supernatants were transferred to autosampler vials for data
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	acquisition. UPLC-MS Methods: UPLC-MS spectra were collected for all samples.
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	UPLC was performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC with an Acquity HSS T3 column (2.1x
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	100mm x 1.8 µm) at 50 °C using the reversed-phase separation. Water with 0.1%
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	formic acid (mobile phase A) and methanol with 0.1% formic acid (mobile phase B)
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	were used as mobile phases and the metabolites were chromatographically
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	separated using a gradient separation: (see the 3.
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Sheridan-Mice-Hypothalamus_RP-Metadata and Analytical Metadata.xlsx file for the
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	flow gradient). Mass spectroscopy analysis was performed using a Synapt G2 Si
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	ESI-Q-TOF using a 10 µL injection volume. UPLC-MS data were collected over
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	70-1000 m/z in both positive and negative modes.

#TREATMENT
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	3-week old mice were placed on a 10% low fat (LF) diet and acclimated for one
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	week prior to intranasal HSV-1 infection or mock infection with PBS. Fourteen
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	days post-infection mice were randomized to either a 45% high fat diet (HF) or
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	remained on the LF diet. Eight weeks post-diet transition, mice were euthanized
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	and brain tissue samples were collected and processed for metabolomics.
