#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	At 5:00 AM after an overnight fast, baseline blood samples were collected from
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	study participants. Plasma samples were stored at 80°C until analysis.
CO:SAMPLE_TYPE                   	Blood. Plasma was isolated for MS analysis.
#TREATMENT
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Participants were admitted to the Clinical Research Unit at St Mary’s Hospital
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	(Rochester, Minnesota) the evening before the study and spent overnight in the
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Clinical Research Unit. The participants were given a standard meal on the
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	evening of the admission after which they fasted overnight. Participants with
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	T1D were treated with insulin as per their usual individual programs. At 5:00 AM
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	after an overnight fast, baseline blood samples were collected from study
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	participants. Plasma samples were stored at 80°C until analysis.
#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Plasma quality-control samples used in the study were prepared from pooled
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	plasma spiked with a selection of metabolites to mimic elevated levels of
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	metabolites during I− (insulin withdrawn) condition. Plasma was spiked with a
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	standard mixture (3:1 ratio of plasma to spiking solution) containing 100 μg/mL
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	niacin, hypoxanthine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, citric
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	acid, glucose, hippuric acid, and taurocholic acid dissolved in 1:1
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	acetonitrile/water. All plasma samples (200 μL) were thawed on ice at 4°C
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	followed by deproteinization with methanol (1:4 ratio of plasma to methanol) and
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	vortexed for 10 s, followed by incubation at −20°C for 2 h. The samples were
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	then centrifuged at 15,871g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatants were
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	lyophilized (Savant, Holbrook, NY) and stored at −20°C prior to analysis. The
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	samples were reconstituted in 50% H2O/acetonitrile and passed through a Microcon
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	YM3 filter (Millipore Corporation). The supernatants were transferred to
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	analytical vials, stored in the autosampler at 4°C, and analyzed within 48 h of
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	reconstitution in buffer.
#CHROMATOGRAPHY
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	Concentration and isotopic enrichment of palmitic acid from extracted plasmas
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	were simultaneously measured against an extracted concentration standard curve
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	as well as an enrichment standard curve on the Applied Biosystem API5000 mass
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	spectrometer-MS (Foster City, CA) coupled with a Cohesive TX2 liquid
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	chromatography system-LC (Franklin, MA). This system provides two LCs connected
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	in parallel to the mass spectrometer, allowing twice the number of samples to be
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	analyzed by using tandem sample injection. The LCs were controlled by Aria
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	software (Cohesive Technology). Palmitic and heptadecanoic acids were separated
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	on the LCs using an Ascentis C18, 2.7 μm, 2.1 × 150 mm column using two
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	buffers. Buffer A was 80% acetonitrile, 0.5 mM ammonium acetate; buffer B was
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	99% acetonitrile, 1% 0.5 mM ammonium acetate. The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min, and
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	the gradient conditions were as follows: 0–8 min isocratic at 55% B, 8–8.5
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	min 55⇒95% B, 8.5–10 min isocratic at 95% B, 10–10.5 min 95⇒55% B, and
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	10.5–12 min isocratic at 55% B. One tenth of the volume of each concentration
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	standard and each plasma sample were resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A prior to
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	injecting 10 μl onto the LC/MS. The chromographic separation of linoleic acid,
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	palmitic acid, oleic acid, eladic acid, and heptadecanoic acid (internal
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	standard) are depicted in Fig. 1A. Although palmitic and oleic acid peaks
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	overlap, they are distinguishable by MS, whereas eladic acid, which is
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	indistinguishable from oleic acid by MS, is easily separated by chromatography.
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	Fig. 1B depicts the M+2 peaks for palmitate and heptadecanoate and the M+16 peak
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	for palmitate of a plasma sample from a volunteer receiving a [U-13C]palmitate
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	infusion. Palmitate elutes at 6.2 min and heptadecanoate acid at 7.1 min;
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	however, in Fig. 1B the retention times are shown as 1.2 and 2.9 min because of
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	the 3 min delay set in the LC method before diverting the flow to the MS for
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	acquisition. The MS was set to acquire for only 5 min, allowing MS data
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	acquisition from the second LC to begin while the first LC finishes its 12 min
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	gradient. The MS was equipped with a turbo ion spray interface with the heater
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	set at 60°C, spray voltage at 5500 V, sheath gas at 50, sweep gas at 40, and
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	transfer capillary at 270°C. Palmitate, [13C16]palmitate and heptadecanoate
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	were selectively monitored at m/z 257, m/z 271 in negative mode. Palmitate was
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	monitored as [M+2−H]− and [M+16−H]−. Heptadecanoic was also monitor as
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	[M+2−H]− . Therefore m/z 271 was either [13C16]palmitate or heptadecanoate,
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	depending on where it eluted in the LC gradient.
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_TYPE        	HPLC-MS
