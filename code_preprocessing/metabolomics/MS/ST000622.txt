#PROJECT
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Identification and metabolite profiling of chemical activators of lipid
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	accumulation in green algae
PR:PROJECT_TYPE                  	GC-MS based Metabolite profiles
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Microalgae are proposed as feedstock organisms useful for producing biofuels and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	co-products. However, several limitations must be overcome before algae-based
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	production is economically feasible. Among these is the ability to induce lipid
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	accumulation and storage without affecting biomass yield. To overcome this
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	barrier, a chemical genetics approach was employed in which 43,783 compounds
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	were screened against Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and 243 compounds were
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	identified that increase triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation without terminating
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	growth. Identified compounds were classified by structural similarity and 15
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	selected for secondary analyses addressing impacts on growth fitness,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	photosynthetic pigments, and total cellular protein and starch concentrations.
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	TAG accumulation was verified using GC-MS quantification of total fatty acids
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	and targeted TAG and galactolipid (GL) measurements using LC-MRM/MS. These
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	results demonstrated TAG accumulation does not necessarily proceed at the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	expense of GL. Untargeted metabolite profiling provided important insights into
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	pathway shifts due to 5 different compound treatments and verified the anabolic
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	state of the cells with regard to the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid biosynthetic pathways.
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Metabolite patterns were distinct from nitrogen starvation and other abiotic
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	stresses commonly used to induce oil accumulation in algae. The efficacy of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	these compounds was also demonstrated in 3 other algal species. These lipid
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	inducing compounds offer a valuable set of tools for delving into the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	biochemical mechanisms of lipid accumulation in algae and a direct means to
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	improve algal oil content independent of the severe growth limitations
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	associated with nutrient deprivation.

#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Cells were pre-grown to mid-log phase and treated with 5 selected compounds
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	(final concentration 5 µM) with an initial cell density of 1.0 x 106 cells/mL
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	(100 mL volume; in triplicate) and allowed to grow for 72 h. After 72 h of
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	growth, cells were harvested, media removed and freeze-dried. Accurately
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	measured 50 ± 0.5 mg of freeze dried powder was used for metabolite extraction.
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Sample powder was pulverized with a single steel ball using TissueLyser LT
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	(Qiagen) at 50 Hz speed for 5 min
#TREATMENT
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Cells were treated either with compounds (5 uM) final concentration in DMSO or
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	DMSO alone (in case of control). Mid-log phase cells were used as starter
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	culture at a initial inoculum density of 1.0E06 cells/mL in 250 mL flasks with
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	100 mL of TAP media. Cells were allowed to grow in orbital shaker under constant
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	light for 72 hours. After 72 hours, experiment was terminated and cells were
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	harvested via centrifugation.
#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Harvested cells were flash frozen in liquid N and freeze dried. Accurately
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	measured 50 ± 0.5 mg of freeze dried powder was used for metabolite extraction.
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Sample powder was pulverized with a single steel ball using TissueLyser LT
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	(Qiagen) at 50 Hz speed for 5 min. One milliliter of extraction buffer
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	containing MeOH:CHCl3:H2O (5:2:2; v/v/v; pre-cooled at -20 °C) was added and
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	vortexed for 5 min. Ribitol (0.2 mg/mL in water; 10 µL) was spiked in the
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	extraction buffer as internal standard in order to identify potential
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	chromatographic errors. The homogenized material was centrifuged at 14000 rpm
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	for 5 min and the supernatant was transferred to new tubes. 400 µL of pure
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	water was added to the supernatant, samples were vortexed and centrifuged at
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	14,000 rpm for 5 min. The upper polar phase was transferred to new tubes for
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	GC-MS analysis. An aliquot of 300 µL was dried out in vacuum concentrator
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	without heating. To the dried material, 10 µL methoxyamine HCL in 100% pyridine
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	(40 mg/mL) was added and shaken at 30 °C for 90 minutes and subsequently 90 µL
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	of MSTFA 1% TMCS was added for trimethylsilylation of acidic protons and shaken
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	at 37 °C for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was transferred to GCvials with
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	glass microinserts and closed by crimp caps. GC-MS data acquisition was
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	performed as per previously published report (Wase et al., 2014)
