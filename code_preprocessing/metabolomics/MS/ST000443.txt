#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	At 5:00 AM after an overnight fast, baseline blood samples were collected from
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	study participants. Plasma samples were stored at 80°C until analysis.
CO:SAMPLE_TYPE                   	Blood. Plasma was isolated for MS analysis.
#TREATMENT
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Participants were admitted to the Clinical Research Unit at St Mary’s Hospital
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	(Rochester, Minnesota) the evening before the study and spent overnight in the
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Clinical Research Unit. The participants were given a standard meal on the
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	evening of the admission after which they fasted overnight. Participants with
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	T1D were treated with insulin as per their usual individual programs. At 5:00 AM
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	after an overnight fast, baseline blood samples were collected from study
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	participants. Plasma samples were stored at 80°C until analysis.
#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Plasma quality-control samples used in the study were prepared from pooled
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	plasma spiked with a selection of metabolites to mimic elevated levels of
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	metabolites during I− (insulin withdrawn) condition. Plasma was spiked with a
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	standard mixture (3:1 ratio of plasma to spiking solution) containing 100 μg/mL
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	niacin, hypoxanthine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, citric
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	acid, glucose, hippuric acid, and taurocholic acid dissolved in 1:1
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	acetonitrile/water. All plasma samples (200 μL) were thawed on ice at 4°C
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	followed by deproteinization with methanol (1:4 ratio of plasma to methanol) and
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	vortexed for 10 s, followed by incubation at −20°C for 2 h. The samples were
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	then centrifuged at 15,871g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatants were
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	lyophilized (Savant, Holbrook, NY) and stored at −20°C prior to analysis. The
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	samples were reconstituted in 50% H2O/acetonitrile and passed through a Microcon
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	YM3 filter (Millipore Corporation). The supernatants were transferred to
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	analytical vials, stored in the autosampler at 4°C, and analyzed within 48 h of
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	reconstitution in buffer.
#CHROMATOGRAPHY
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	The derivatized extracts were analyzed with an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	coupled with an Agilent 5973 mass selective detector. The 1-μL aliquots of the
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	extracts were injected into a DB5-MS capillary column (30 m × 250 μm i.d.,
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	0.25-μm film thickness; J&W Scientific, Folson, CA) using PTV injection
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	(Gerstel CIS4 injector) in the splitless mode. The temperature of the PTV was 70
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	°C during injection, and 0.6 min after injection, the temperature was raised to
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	300 °C at a rate of 2 °C/s and held at 300 °C for 20 min. The initial GC oven
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	temperature was 70 °C, 5 min after injection the GC oven temperature was
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	increased with 5 °C/min to 320 °C and held for 5 min at 320 °C. Helium was
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	used as a carrier gas and pressure programmed such that the helium flow was kept
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	constant at a flow rate of 1.7 mL/min. Detection was achieved using MS detection
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	in electron impact mode and full scan monitoring mode (m/z 15−800). The
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	temperature of the ion source was set at 250 °C and that of the quadrupole at
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	200 °C.
