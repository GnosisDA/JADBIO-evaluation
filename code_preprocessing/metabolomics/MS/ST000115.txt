PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Impact of insulin deprivation and treatment on sphingolipid distribution in
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	muscle subcellular compartments of streptozotocin-diabetic C57Bl/6 mice.
PR:PROJECT_TYPE                  	Targeted metabolomics
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Insulin deprivation in type 1 diabetes (T1D) individuals increases lipolysis
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	plasma free fatty acids (FFA) concentration, which can stimulate synthesis of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	bioactive lipids such as ceramides (Cer) and long-chain fatty acid-CoAs
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Ceramide was shown to decrease muscle insulin sensitivity, and at mitochondrial
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	it stimulates reactive oxygen species production. Here, we show that insulin
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	in streptozotocin diabetic C57BL/6 mice increases quadriceps muscle Cer
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	which was correlated with a concomitant decrease in the body fat and increased
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	FFA, glycosylated hemoglobin level (%Hb A1c), and muscular LCFa-CoA content.
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	alternations were accompanied by an increase in protein expression in LCFa-CoA
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Cer synthesis (FATP1/ACSVL5, CerS1, CerS5), a decrease in the expression of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	implicated in muscle insulin sensitivity (GLUT4, GYS1), and inhibition of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	signaling cascade by Akt? and GYS3? phosphorylation under acute insulin
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Both the content and composition of sarcoplasmic fraction sphingolipids were
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	affected by insulin deprivation, whereas mitochondrial fraction sphingolipids
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	stable. The observed effects of insulin deprivation were reversed, except for
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	and composition of LCFa-CoA, CerS protein expression, GYS1 gene expression, and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	status of Akt and GYS3? when exogenous insulin was provided by subcutaneous
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	implants. Principal component analysis and Pearson's correlation analysis
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	close relationships between the features of the diabetic phenotype, the content
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	LCFa-CoAs and Cers containing C18-fatty acids in sarcoplasm, but not in
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Insulin replacement did not completely rescue the phenotype, especially
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	the content of LCFa-CoA, or proteins implicated in Cer synthesis and muscle
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	sensitivity. These persistent changes might contribute to muscle insulin
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	observed in T1D individuals.

#STUDY
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	Impact of insulin deprivation and treatment on sphingolipid distribution in
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	muscle subcellular compartments of streptozotocin-diabetic C57Bl/6 mice
ST:STUDY_TYPE                    	Insulin depravation
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	Experiments were conducted using 13-wk-old male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housed individually with free access to water and
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	(TD.10112; Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN), with a 12:12-h light-dark
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	and temperature and humidity control. Mice were acclimated for 1 wk prior to
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	beginning of the experiment. The protocol was approved by the Mayo Clinic
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	Animal Care and Use Committee. Following a 6-h fast, mice were given
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	injections of STZ (125 mg/kg; in sodium acetate buffer, pH = 4.5) (67).
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	were repeated on the following day. Control animals received intraperitoneal
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	of vehicle. Only mice that displayed blood glucose ?300 mg/dl and an increase
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	blood ketones (both values by Precision Xtra glucometer; Abbott Laboratories,
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	Park, IL), hyperphagia, and polyuria and were positive for urine glucose
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	via dipstick (Uristix, Bayer, Pittsburgh, PA) on day 7 after the first STZ dose
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	included in the experiment. Animals that were positive for STZ diabetes
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	LinBit subcutaneous insulin implant (LinShin Canada, Toronto, ON, Canada) (79)
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	pentobarbital sodium anesthesia (Nebutal, 40 mg/kg of body wt) according to the
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	protocol. Each animal received two subcutaneous implants (total dose: 0.2 U/24
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	for >30 days, 10 U/kg for 20-g mice). Insulin treatment was continued for 3 wk.
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	animals (C; n = 13) received blank implants. Diabetic control was confirmed by
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	measurements of blood and urinary glucose. In some cases, when urine glucose
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	present and blood glucose was >288 mg/dl, the animal received a third implant.
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	insulin treatment was continued until initially lower plasma glucose content in
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	animals reached control values. Three weeks following implantation, diabetic
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	were divided randomly into diabetic-treated (D + I; n = 13) and
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	(D ? I; n = 13) groups. Insulin implants were removed from the D ? I group
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	pentobarbital anesthesia, which led to the return of the diabetic phenotype
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	24 h. Animals from the D + I group continued on insulin treatment (Fig. 1). At
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	age of 18 wk, animals from all groups were analyzed for body composition by an
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	Body Composition Analyzer (EchoMRI, Houston, TX) and euthanized by decapitation
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	wk after the initial STZ or vehicle dose. Figure 1 depicts the timeline of the
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	and blood glucose profiles for each experimental group. Additional animals were
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	for estimation of skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity by acute insulin
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	The mice were divided into the C (n = 6), D ? I (n = 7), and D + I (n = 7)
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	and followed appropriate experimental treatment, except for acute insulin
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	10 min prior to euthanization by pentobarbital overdose. Figure 1 of the
