PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	The Malaria Host-Pathogen Interaction Center (MaHPIC)
PR:PROJECT_TYPE                  	Systems Biology
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	The Malaria Host-Pathogen Interaction Center (MaHPIC) is a transdisciplinary
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	malaria systems biology research program supported by an NIH/NIAID contract (#
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	HHSN272201200031C; see http://www.systemsbiology.emory.edu/index.html). The
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	MaHPIC generates many data types (e.g., metabolomics, functional genomics,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	lipidomics, proteomics, clinical, parasitological, immune response) and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	mathematical models, to iteratively test and develop hypotheses related to the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	complex host-parasite dynamics in the course of malaria in non-human primates,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	and metabolomics data via collaborations with investigators conducting clinical
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	studies in malaria endemic countries, with the overarching goal of better
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	understanding human disease, pathogenesis, and immunity. Curation and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	maintenance of all data and metadata are the responsibility of the MaHPIC:

#STUDY
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	Metabolomics of longitudinal plasma samples from Macaca mulatta infected
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	with Plasmodium cynomolgi B strain.
ST:STUDY_TYPE                    	Longitudinal parasite infection and treatment of multiple individuals
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	Malaria-naive male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), approximately three years
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	of age, were inoculated intravenously with salivary gland sporozoites isolated
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from multiple Anopheles
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	species (An. dirus, An. gambiae, and An. stephensi) and then profiled for
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	parasitological, clinical, immunological, functional genomic, lipidomic,
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	proteomic, and metabolomic measurements. The experiment was designed for 100
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	days, and pre- and post-100 day periods to prepare subjects and administer
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	curative treatments respectively. The anti-malarial drug Artemether was
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	subcuratively administered selectively to several subjects during the primary
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	parasitemia to suppress clinical complications and to all animals for curative
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	treatment of blood-stage infections to allow detection of relapses. One subject
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	was euthanized during the 100-day experimental period due to clinical
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	complications. The anti-malarial drugs Primaquine and Chloroquine were
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	administered to all remaining subjects at the end of the study for curative
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	treatment of the liver and blood-stage infections, respectively. Plasma samples
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	were acquired every other day from capillary blood and during seven-time point
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	collections of venous blood. Supplemental files, including a ReadMe with
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	additional experimental details, all raw data, and analytical metadata, are
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	provided as part of this submission.
