#PROJECT
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Etiologies of preterm delivery among obese women
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Here we propose a pilot project to examine the contribution of lipid mediators
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	and lipidomics to preterm delivery among obese women. Preterm delivery is one of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	the top causes of infant morbidity and mortality. Our specific interests are in
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	understanding risks of preterm delivery among obese women, and in particular the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	contribution of the inflammatory response to early preterm delivery (<32 weeks)
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	among obese women. The inflammatory response is a known contributor to preterm
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	delivery, and obesity is associated with inflammation and an increased risk of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	early preterm delivery, but the distinct contribution of aberrations in the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	inflammatory response to preterm delivery among obese women has not been
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	examined previously. Most previous studies of preterm delivery and the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	inflammatory response have examined one or only a few of its components at once,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	primarily cytokines, and a few studies have examined dyslipidemia. We propose to
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	extend these types of investigations by examining lipid mediators and conducting
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	global lipid profiling. Lipid mediators are key regulators of inflammation and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	include fatty acids and their oxygenated bioactive metabolites such as oxylipins
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	(e.g., prostaglandins, HETEs or hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, and other
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	eicosanoids), ceramides and sphingoid bases including sphingosine-1-phosphate.
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Examination of lipid mediators and lipid profiling is particularly relevant to
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	understanding distinct risks among obese women, given the known
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	inter-relatedness of obesity, dyslipidemia, and inflammation. Our overarching
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	hypothesis is that the inflammatory response impacts risk of preterm delivery
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	and that its impact is distinct among obese versus non-obese women. Here we
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	propose a pilot project that compares mid-pregnancy measurements of lipid
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	mediators and lipid profiling among obese pregnant women. Findings from this
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	pilot will provide critical preliminary data to inform larger-scope grant
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	proposals that will comprehensively address our overarching hypothesis.
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Specifically, we will examine mid-pregnancy lipid mediators in obese women who
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	deliver preterm compared to those who deliver at term. In addition, we will use
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	untargeted global profiling of complex lipids to determine whether obese women
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	who deliver preterm have a distinct lipidomic signature, relative to obese women
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	who deliver at term. We propose a nested case-control study that utilizes
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	maternal mid-pregnancy (15-20 weeks gestation) serum samples from a biobank that
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	represents over one million deliveries in California from 2007-2012. We propose
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	to examine 50 obese women who delivered preterm and 50 who delivered at term.
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	This will provide adequate preliminary data for a larger-scale grant proposal.

#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	"The collection and processing of specimens was as follows: 1) samples were
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	taken at draw stations using BDTM Vacutainer 3.5 mL serum separator tubes with
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	no anticoagulants or preservatives and centrifuged 2) samples were received by
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	designated clinical laboratories from draw stations at room temperature, on
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	average 3.0 days after draw 3) AFP assays were run on samples usually on the day
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	received 4) samples were refrigerated up to 7 days, in case further testing was
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	necessary 5) samples were sent on cold packs via overnight mail to the serum
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	storage bank 6) samples were aliquoted, labeled with barcodes, and frozen at
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	−70° C."

TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Among the more than 100,000 pregnancy specimens collected for testing in 2003
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	and that resulted in a liveborn delivery in 2003, we identified 63 cases with
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	hypospadias. Among the 29 cases for which two serum specimens were available, we
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	selected all 16 for whom the degree of severity was not specified and the four
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	that were coronal, to give a total of 20 cases. As controls, we randomly
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	selected 28 specimens that were collected at the same lab during the same time
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	period and corresponded to non-malformed, liveborn male infants delivered in
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	2003. Thus, this was a nested case-control study. The selection of samples was
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	limited to singletons. All samples were obtained with approval from the
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	California Health and Welfare Agency Committee for the Protection of Human
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Subjects.

#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Non-esterified oxylipins, endocannabinoids, polyunsaturated fatty acids and bile
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	acids extraction: Oxylipins, endocannabinoids, fatty acids and bile acids were
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	isolated by liquid extraction protocol using methanol/acetonitrile mixture (1:1
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	v/v] from 40 µL of serum and quantified by UPLC-MS/MS using internal standard
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	methods. Procedure shortly: 40 µL of serum was mixed with 5 µL BHT/EDTA (1:1
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	MeOH:water), 10 µL of 0.5 µM deuterated oxylipins and endocannabinoids
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	surrogates and 20 µL of 1 µM deuterated bile acids surrogates in methanol.
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Next, serum was homogenized by addition of 200 µL of 1-cyclohexyl ureido,
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	3-dodecanoic acid (CUDA) and 1-phenyl ureido 3-hexanoic acid (PUHA) at 100 nM in
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	1:1 methanol:acetonitrile. Next, homogenate was centrifuge at 15000 rcf for 10
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	min and the methanol/acetonitrile supernatant was collected for mass
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	spectrometry analysis.
