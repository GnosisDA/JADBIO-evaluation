PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	The Malaria Host-Pathogen Interaction Center (MaHPIC) is a transdisciplinary
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	malaria systems biology research program supported by an NIH/NIAID contract (#
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	HHSN272201200031C; see http://www.systemsbiology.emory.edu). The MaHPIC
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	generates many data types (e.g., clinical, parasitological, metabolomics,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	functional genomics, lipidomics, proteomics, immune response) and mathematical
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	models, to iteratively test and develop hypotheses related to the complex
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	host-parasite dynamics in the course of malaria in non-human primates, and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	metabolomics data via collaborations with investigators conducting clinical
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	studies in malaria endemic countries, with the overarching goal of better
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	understanding human disease, pathogenesis, and immunity. Curation and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	maintenance of all data and metadata are the responsibility of the MaHPIC.

#STUDY
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	Experiment 13: Uninfected Macaca mulatta exposed to pyrimethamine to produce and
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	integrate clinical, hematological, and omics control measures.
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	Uninfected, malaria-naive, male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), approximately
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	two years of age, were inoculated intravenously with a preparation of salivary
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	gland material derived from non-infected Anopheles dirus and profiled for
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	clinical, hematological, functional genomic, lipidomic, proteomic, and
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	metabolomic measurements. Samples were generated and analyzed to investigate the
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	effects of the pharmacological intervention with the anti-malarial drug
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	pyrimethamine on normal individuals. The experiment was designed for 100 days
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	plus a follow-up period, with pyrimethamine administered at three different time
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	points to coincide with the predicted treatment days of experimentally infected
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	rhesus macaques. Capillary blood samples were collected daily for the
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	measurement of CBCs and reticulocytes. Capillary blood samples were collected
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	every other day to obtain plasma for metabolomic analysis. Venous blood samples
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	and bone marrow aspirates were collected at seven time points before and after
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	three rounds of drug administration for functional genomic, proteomic, and
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	lipidomic analyses. Within the MaHPIC, this project is known as 'Experiment 13'.
