#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	At 5:00 AM after an overnight fast, baseline blood samples were collected from
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	study participants. Plasma samples were stored at 80°C until analysis.
CO:SAMPLE_TYPE                   	Blood. Plasma was isolated for MS analysis.
#TREATMENT
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Participants were admitted to the Clinical Research Unit at St Mary’s Hospital
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	(Rochester, Minnesota) the evening before the study and spent overnight in the
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Clinical Research Unit. The participants were given a standard meal on the
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	evening of the admission after which they fasted overnight. Participants with
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	T1D were treated with insulin as per their usual individual programs. At 5:00 AM
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	after an overnight fast, baseline blood samples were collected from study
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	participants. Plasma samples were stored at 80°C until analysis.
#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Plasma quality-control samples used in the study were prepared from pooled
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	plasma spiked with a selection of metabolites to mimic elevated levels of
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	metabolites during I− (insulin withdrawn) condition. Plasma was spiked with a
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	standard mixture (3:1 ratio of plasma to spiking solution) containing 100 μg/mL
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	niacin, hypoxanthine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, citric
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	acid, glucose, hippuric acid, and taurocholic acid dissolved in 1:1
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	acetonitrile/water. All plasma samples (200 μL) were thawed on ice at 4°C
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	followed by deproteinization with methanol (1:4 ratio of plasma to methanol) and
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	vortexed for 10 s, followed by incubation at −20°C for 2 h. The samples were
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	then centrifuged at 15,871g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatants were
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	lyophilized (Savant, Holbrook, NY) and stored at −20°C prior to analysis. The
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	samples were reconstituted in 50% H2O/acetonitrile and passed through a Microcon
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	YM3 filter (Millipore Corporation). The supernatants were transferred to
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	analytical vials, stored in the autosampler at 4°C, and analyzed within 48 h of
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	reconstitution in buffer.
#CHROMATOGRAPHY
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	Plasma samples and amino acid calibration standards were prepared with MassTrak
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	Amino Acid Analysis Solution (AAA) kit from Waters according to instructions
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	with slight modifications for detection on a mass spectrometer. A 10 point
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	standard concentration curve was made from the calibration standard solution to
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	calculate amino acid concentrations in plasma samples. A solution containing
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	U-13C4-L-aspartic acid, U-13C3-L-alanine, U-13C4-L-threonine, U-13C5-L-proline,
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	U-13C5-L-valine, U-13C6-leucine, U-13C6-phenylalanine all from Cambridge Isotope
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	Laboratories, 13C6-tyrosine from Isotec, L-arginine (15N2, 2H2) from MassTrace,
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	norvaline from Sigma dissolved in 0.01N HCl was used as the internal standard
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	solution. Frozen plasma samples were thawed, spiked with internal standard then
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	deproteinized with cold MeOH followed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	minutes prior to derivatization according to MassTrak instructions. The amino
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	acid derivatizing reagent used was 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	carbamate. High resolution separation was done using an Acquity UPLC system,
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	injecting 1 µl of derviatized solution, with a UPLC BEH C18 1.7 micron 2.1×150
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	mm column from Waters. Column flow was set to 400 µl/min with a gradient from
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	99.9%A to 98%B where buffer A is 1% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid and buffer
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	B is 100% acetonitrile. A column temp of 43 degrees Celsius and a sample tray
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	temp of 6% Celsius. Mass detection was completed on a TSQ Ultra Quantum from
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	Thermo Finnigan running in ESI positive mode. A scan width of 0.002, scan time
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	of 0.04 seconds per transition mass, collision energy of 25, collision gas
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	pressure of 1.5 mTorr, tube lens value set to 90, monitoring a signature ion of
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY     	the derivitized amines at m/z 171.04 by selected reaction monitoring.
