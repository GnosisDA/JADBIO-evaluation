PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Sparing of muscle mass and function by passive loading in an experimental
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	care unit model
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	The response to mechanical stimuli, i.e. tensegrity, plays an important role in
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	cell physiological and pathophysiological function, and the mechanical
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	observed in intensive care unit (ICU) patients leads to a severe and specific
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	wasting condition. This study aims to unravel the underlying mechanisms and the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	of passive mechanical loading on skeletal muscle mass and function at the gene,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	and cellular levels. A unique experimental rat ICU model has been used allowing
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	(weeks) time-resolved analyses of the effects of standardized unilateral
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	mechanical loading on skeletal muscle size and function and underlying
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Results show that passive mechanical loading alleviated the muscle wasting and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	loss of force-generation associated with the ICU intervention, resulting in a
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	of the functional capacity of the loaded versus the unloaded muscles after a
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	ICU intervention. We demonstrate that the improved maintenance of muscle mass
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	function is probably a consequence of a reduced oxidative stress revealed by
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	levels of carbonylated proteins, and a reduced loss of the molecular motor
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	myosin. A complex temporal gene expression pattern, delineated by microarray
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	was observed with loading-induced changes in transcript levels of sarcomeric
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	muscle developmental processes, stress response, extracellular matrix/cell
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	proteins and metabolism. Thus, the results from this study show that passive
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	loading alleviates the severe negative consequences on muscle size and function
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	with the mechanical silencing in ICU patients, strongly supporting early and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	physical therapy in immobilized ICU patients.

#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	The tibialis anterior (TA), extensor digitorum longus (EDL), plantaris,
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	and soleus muscles were dissected from the loaded left leg and the unloaded
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	leg immediately after death. One half of the soleus and EDL muscles together
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	TA and gastrocnemius were quickly frozen in liquid propane cooled by liquid
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	and stored at ?160°C for further analyses. In the other halves of the soleus
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	EDL muscles, bundles of approximately 50 fibres were dissected from the muscles
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	relaxing solution at 4°C and tied to glass capillaries, stretched to about
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	of their resting slack length. The bundles were chemically skinned for 24 h in
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	solution containing 50% (v/v) glycerol for 24 h at 4°C and were subsequently
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	at ?20°C (Larsson & Moss, 1993). All the bundles were cryo-protected within 1
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	after skinning by transferring the bundles every 30 min to relax solution
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	increasing concentrations of sucrose, i.e. 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 m, and
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	frozen in liquid propane chilled with liquid nitrogen (Frontera & Larsson,
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	The frozen bundles were stored at ?160°C pending use. One day before the
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	a bundle was transferred to a 2.0 m sucrose solution for 30 min, subsequently
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	in solutions of decreasing sucrose concentration (1.5?0.5 m) and finally kept
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	a skinning solution at ?20°C.

#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	An i.v. bolus dose of [ring-13C6]phenylalanine (15 ?g g?1 body weight) was
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	15 min prior to the animals being killed. Immediately after death, the
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	muscle was removed from the left and right hindlimb and split into a medial and
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	deep red and superficial white portion and frozen in liquid propane chilled by
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	nitrogen. Tissue fluid and mixed gastrocnemius muscle proteins were isolated
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	to the method of Ljungqvist et al. (1997). The mixed muscle protein precipitate
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	the isolation was hydrolysed by heating with 6 m HCl overnight at 110°C. Both
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	fluid and hydrolysed mixed gastrocnemius muscle amino acids were purified using
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	BioRad AG-50 × 8 ion exchange resin prior to mass spectrometry
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	fluid The level of enrichment of [ring-13C6]phenylalanine in tissue fluid
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	analysed using ThermoFisher Quantum gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	(San Jose, CA, USA). The heptafluorobutyryl isobutyl ester derivative was
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	as described by Ford et al. (1985) and the amino acids were measured under
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	ion chemical ionisation conditions using isobutane as reactant gas. The [M-HF]?
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	reflecting the m0 and m+6 species were monitored (m/z transitions 397?377 and
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	respectively) and the enrichment of the label was measured against a
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	curve prepared from known amounts of labelled and unlabelled phenylalanine
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	0?30%).
#CHROMATOGRAPHY
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	The level of enrichment of [ring-13C6]phenylalanine derived from hydrolysed
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	muscle proteins were analysed using a ThermoFisher DeltaPlus Isotope Ratio mass
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	(IR/MS) (Bremen, Germany) fitted with an on-line gas chromatograph with
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	and reduction furnaces as previously described (Balagopal et al. 1996). The
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	acids were derivatized to their trimethyl acetyl, methyl esters according to
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	method of Metges et al. (1996). Any amino acid eluting from the gas
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	is converted to CO2 and N2 prior to entry into the IR/MS. The amino acids were
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	to their trimethyl acetyl, methyl esters according to the method of Metges et
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	(1996). Enrichment of the tracer was measured by monitoring the ratio of 13C to
CH:CHROMATOGRAPHY_SUMMARY        	in the IR/MS and again referenced to a calibration curve (00.1%).
