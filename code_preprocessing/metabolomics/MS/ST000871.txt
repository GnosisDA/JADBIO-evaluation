#PROJECT
PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Causal genetic variation underlying metabolome differences
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	A goal of biology is to predict the phenotypes of individuals, such as side
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	effects to drugs, from their genotypes. Genetic variants that cause disease can
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	change an individual’s total metabolite profile, or metabolome. Understanding
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	the function of these genetic variants may help predict novel phenotypes. We
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	used an unbiased method in yeast to show that genetic differences in two genes
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	change the levels of several urea cycle metabolites. Leveraging knowledge of the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	urea cycle, we then predicted and validated the sensitivity of yeast strains to
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	a particular drug. The interpretability of our results demonstrates the promise
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	of using genetic variants underlying differences in the metabolome to predict
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	novel phenotypes from genotype.

CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	base minus amino acids/ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 2% dextrose) to
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	an OD of 0.55 - 0.65. We harvested cells by vacuum filter.

TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	an OD of 0.55 - 0.65. Different genotypes were used, and media was made at three
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	separate times (batch).
#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	We harvested cells by vacuum filter, and extracted hydrophilic metabolites from

SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	and thawed extracts at -80 °C and -20 °C, respectively, three times. We
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	pelleted cells, and stored the supernatant at -80 °C until we performed mass
