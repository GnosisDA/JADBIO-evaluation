PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	The Malaria Host-Pathogen Interaction Center (MaHPIC) is a transdisciplinary
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	malaria systems biology research program supported by an NIH/NIAID contract (#
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	HHSN272201200031C; see http://www.systemsbiology.emory.edu). The MaHPIC
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	generates many data types (e.g., clinical, parasitological, metabolomics,
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	functional genomics, lipidomics, proteomics, immune response) and mathematical
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	models, to iteratively test and develop hypotheses related to the complex
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	host-parasite dynamics in the course of malaria in non-human primates, and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	metabolomics data via collaborations with investigators conducting clinical
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	studies in malaria endemic countries, with the overarching goal of better
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	understanding human disease, pathogenesis, and immunity. Curation and
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	maintenance of all data and metadata are the responsibility of the MaHPIC.

#STUDY
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	Metabolomics measures of Macaca mulatta infected with Plasmodium coatneyi
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	Hackeri strain to produce and integrate clinical, hematological,
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	parasitological, and omics measures of acute, recrudescent, and chronic
ST:STUDY_TITLE                   	infections.
ST:STUDY_TYPE                    	Longitudinal parasite infection and treatment of multiple individuals
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	Malaria-naive male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), approximately four years of
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	age, were inoculated intravenously with salivary gland sporozoites produced and
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	isolated at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from multiple
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	Anopheles species (An. dirus, An. gambiae, and An. stephensi) and then profiled
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	for clinical, hematological, parasitological, immunological, functional genomic,
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	lipidomic, proteomic, and metabolomic measurements. The experiment was designed
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	for 100 days, and pre- and post-100 day periods to prepare subjects and
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	administer curative treatments respectively. The anti-malarial drug artemether
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	was subcuratively administered to all subjects at the initial peak of infection,
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	one out of the five macaques received four additional subcurative treatments for
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	subsequent recrudescence peaks. The experimental infection in one subject was
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	ineffective but the macaque was followed-up for the same period of 100 days. The
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	different clinical phases of the infection were clinically determined for each
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	subject. Blood-stage curative doses of artemether were administered to all
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	subjects at the end of the study. Capillary blood samples were collected daily
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	for the measurement of CBCs, reticulocytes, and parasitemias. Capillary blood
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	samples were collected every other day to obtain plasma for metabolomic
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	analysis. Venous blood and bone marrow samples were collected at seven time
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	points for functional genomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and immunological analyses.
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	Within the MaHPIC, this project is known as ‘Experiment 03’. This dataset
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	was produced by Dean Jones at Emory University. The experimental design and
ST:STUDY_SUMMARY                 	protocols for this study were approved by the Emory University Institutional

#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Every Other Day Collection | Time Point 1 Baseline: Uninfected control for each
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Non-Human Primate (NHP). | Time Point 2 Peak of infection: Peak of infection
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	determined by clinical and parasitological assessment for each NHP. The time
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	point is intended to characterize the host immune response and capture
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	multi-omics data during the peak of parasitemias when the NHP is experiencing
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	clinical signs of disease that are commonly severe in P. coatneyi infections.
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	NHPs were monitored based on clinical and hematological parameters, and clinical
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	interventions with artemether were performed as necessary. | Time Point 3
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Post-peak: Observations 7 days after peak infection and sub-curative treatment.
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	| Time Point 4 Recrudescence Peak: This time point tested expectations of a drop
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	in hemoglobin levels and increase in parasitemias due to recrudescence from a
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	chronic infection. After sample collection, NHPs received sub-curative treatment
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	with artemether based on clinical and hematological parameters. | Time Point 5
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Post-peak: Chronic infection with low levels of persistent parasitemia that may
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	be below detectable levels. | Time Point 6 Recrudescence Peak: Same goal as time
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	point 4 for 2nd second recrudescence peak. | Time Point 7 Post-peak:
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	Observations of NHP response after a second recrudescence in a chronic phase
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	with low levels of persistent parasitemia.
