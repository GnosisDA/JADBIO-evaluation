#COLLECTION
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	The FF samples were collected based on follicular aspiration after ovarian
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	controlled stimulation protocol, defined by the doctor prior to the begining of
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	the treatment. Follicular fluid samples were collectd and centrifuged at 800 ×
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	g for 10 minutes to separate the fluid from follicular cells and the samples
CO:COLLECTION_SUMMARY            	were maintained frozen in -20 °C until the metabolites extraction.
#TREATMENT
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	Does not apply. Patients were treated for infertility according to their medical
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	needs. The present study has no interference on patients management and it is
TR:TREATMENT_SUMMARY             	defined as a prospective case-control study.
#SAMPLEPREP
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	The FF samples were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 minutes to separate the fluid
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	from follicular cells and the samples were maintained frozen in -20 °C until
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	the metabolites extraction. The Bligh & Dyer protocol (1959) was applied for
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	proteins removal and was performed as herein: 50 µL of sample was placed in a
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	microtube, followed by addition of 50 µL of milli-Q water, 125 µL of
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	chloroform (CHCl3 - Merck Millipore, MA, EUA) and 250 µL of methanol (MeOH -
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Merck Millipore - Massachusetts, EUA). The mixture was vortexed for 30 seconds.
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Next, polar and apolar phases were separated by the addition of 100 µL of
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	milli-Q water and 125 µL of CHCl3 (Merck Millipore, MA EUA). Both polar and
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	apolar phases were collected and transferred to a new microtube. The final
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	content was dried by using a speedvac (CentriVap Cold Trap, Labconco, MO, USA).
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	Prior to the LC-MS analysis, the metabolites were recovered by using 100 µL of
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	acetonitrile and water (ACN:H2O 1:1, v:v - Merk Millipore, MA, USA) and filtered
SP:SAMPLEPREP_SUMMARY            	in 0.22 μm PVDF filters (Merck Millipore, MA, EUA).
