PR:PROJECT_TITLE                 	Cold Storage of Rat Hepatocyte Spheroids
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Cell-based therapies for liver disease rely on a high-quality supply of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	and a means for storage during transportation from site of isolation to site of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	Unfortunately, frozen cryopreservation is associated with unacceptable loss of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	viability after thawing. The purpose of this study was to optimize conditions
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	cold storage of rat hepatocyte spheroids without freezing. Rat hepatocytes were
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	by a two-step perfusion method; hepatocyte spheroids were formed during 48 h of
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	culture in serum-free medium (SFM). Spheroids were then maintained in rocked
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	at 37 °C (control condition) or cold stored at 4 °C for 24 or 48 h in six
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	cold storage solutions: SFM alone; SFM + 1 mM deferoxamine (Def); SFM + 1 ?M
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	A (CsA); SFM + 1 mM Def + 1 ?M CsA, University of Wisconsin (UW) solution
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	UW + 1 mM Def. Performance metrics after cold storage included viability, gene
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	albumin production, and functional activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes and urea
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	proteins. We observed that cold-induced injury was reduced significantly by the
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	of the iron chelator (Def) to both SFM and UW solution. Performance metrics
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	detoxification, albumin production) of rat hepatocyte spheroids stored in SFM +
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	for 24 h were significantly increased from SFM alone and approached those in
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	conditions, while performance metrics after cold storage in SFM alone or cold
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	for 48 h were both significantly reduced. A serum-free medium supplemented with
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	allowed hepatocyte spheroids to tolerate 24 h of cold storage with less than
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	loss in viability and functionality. Further research is warranted to optimize
PR:PROJECT_SUMMARY               	solution for extended cold storage of hepatocyte spheroids.
