# JADBIO-evaluation

This repository provides scripts for reproducing the results presented in the paper "Just Add Data: Automated Predictive Modeling and BioSignature Discovery" ([bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.04.075747v1)).

Specifically, you can find and download:

* The scripts that we used to produce the figures (code_figures folder)

* The code for reproducing auto-sklearn results (code_auto-sklearn folder)

* Scripts for preprocessing the raw data (code_preprocessing folder)
