This folder will contain the results produced by auto-sklearn. 
Each auto-sklearn analysis will produce a distinct folder, containing the following files:

- cvRes.csv: each configuration tried by auto-sklearn, along with obtained performance and computational time.

- error.txt: any error message printed by auto-sklearn.

- etime.txt: the global computational time in seconds.

- holdoutRes.csv: predictions on the hold-out set of the ensemble and best model provided by auto-sklearn.

- out.txt: any output message printed by auto-sklearn.
